# Incorrect Use of the $inc Operator in MongoDB

This example demonstrates an incorrect use of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, in this example, a string is used instead of a number, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to use the `$inc` operator.
